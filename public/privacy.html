  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 2025</p>

  <p>TalkHint, a product of <strong>All Digital Land LLC</strong>, respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through this policy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our website, phone numbers, or services.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>TalkHint is an AI-assisted phone service that helps users during live voice conversations. We do not record calls or messages. Suggestions are generated in real time and displayed on screen. The user chooses which response to say out loud — AI never replaces the human voice.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic device metadata (e.g., browser, IP, language)</li>
    <li>AI interaction data (e.g., which suggestions were shown or selected)</li>
    <li>No voice recordings or message content is stored</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use information to provide the TalkHint experience, analyze usage patterns, improve suggestion accuracy, and ensure security. We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing.</p>

  <h2>4. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
  <p>We use Google Analytics to understand usage trends. You can disable cookies in your browser to limit tracking.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain only non-identifiable usage logs (e.g., page visits, number of suggestions used). No user voice data or messages are stored.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>If you are a resident of California or a region with similar data protection laws, you have the right to access or request deletion of your data. To request data removal, contact us via the email below.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>TalkHint is not intended for use by individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect information from minors.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
